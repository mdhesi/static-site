 Learning to connect to servers

 Before you start creating web applications in Java I highly recommend first trying to create a simple static website. This will teach you the basics of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS which I think are also necessary for every serious Java developer. I’m not talking about some fancy advanced stuff, try to create a simple single html file like ‘Blog’ with two example entries, and try to make it public. If you are completely new to web development that might be difficult for you but at the same time you will learn a lot of things such as how to connect to your server to put your static files, how to setup domain and point it to your server and many more which you will find out yourself along the way.
